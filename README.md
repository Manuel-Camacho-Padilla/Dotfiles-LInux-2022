# Dotfiles-LInux-2022
Hello!
I am a university student from TÃ©cnologico de Monterrey in Mexico, who is fond of programming and operating systems.
I hope to delve into cybersecurity. Anyway, these are the dotfiles from the year 2022. I use Arch Linux with Qtile.

Feel free to get inspired and copy what you want, the code is free :)

You can contact me for any questions at manu320camacho@outlook.com
